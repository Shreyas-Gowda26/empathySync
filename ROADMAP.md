# EmpathySync Roadmap

> "Help that knows when to stop"

## Project Goals

1. **Prove AI can genuinely help humans** — without exploiting them in the process.
2. **Create a reusable "soul"** — a decoupled safety-aware core that can be embedded in other AI projects. The classification pipeline, dependency detection, and restraint philosophy should be importable, not locked inside a Streamlit app.
3. **Build for people tired of the noise** — for users seeking an alternative to AI tools that optimize for engagement over wellbeing.

These three goals anchor every phase below.

---

This roadmap implements the suggestions for making EmpathySync a more nuanced, effective tool that provides full practical assistance while maintaining appropriate restraint on sensitive topics.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Fixes ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Fix the core practical/sensitive distinction so the system actually works as intended.

### 1.1 Two-Pass Detection System ✅ DONE
- [x] Update `base_prompt.yaml` with dual-mode instructions
- [x] Update `styles.yaml` with mode-specific word limits
- [x] Update `logistics.yaml` with comprehensive practical task indicators
- [x] Modify `WellnessPrompts` to inject practical mode instructions
- [x] Modify `WellnessGuide` to use 2000 tokens for practical, 300 for sensitive
- [x] Skip response truncation for practical tasks
- [x] Update `CLAUDE.md` documentation

### 1.2 Intent Detection ✅ SUPERSEDED
> **Note**: This was superseded by Phase 4 (Session Intent Check-In) and Phase 9 (LLM-Based Classification).
> Intent detection is now handled by `RiskClassifier.detect_intent()` and the LLM classifier for context-aware understanding.

---

## Phase 2: Emotional Weight Layer ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Recognize that some practical tasks carry emotional weight and handle them with appropriate acknowledgment.

### 2.1 Emotional Weight Detection ✅ DONE
**Problem**: "Write a resignation email" is practical but emotionally heavy. "Write me a grocery list" is not.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Add `emotional_weight` field to domain/task classification
- [x] Create `scenarios/emotional_weight/task_weights.yaml` with categories:
  - High weight (48 triggers): resignation, breakup, difficult conversation, apology, grief
  - Medium weight (27 triggers): negotiation, complaint, vulnerable asks
  - Low weight: default for all other logistics tasks

**New classification output**:
```python
{
    "domain": "logistics",
    "emotional_weight": "high_weight",
    "emotional_weight_score": 8.0,
    "emotional_intensity": 0,
    "dependency_risk": 0,
    "risk_weight": 1.0
}
```

### 2.2 Weighted Practical Responses ✅ DONE
- [x] For high emotional weight + practical intent:
  - Complete the task fully (no restrictions)
  - Add brief human acknowledgment at the end (not therapeutic, just human)
  - Example: "Here's the template. These transitions are hard. You'll find your words when the time comes."
- [x] Category-specific acknowledgments (endings, apologies, grief, relationship_endings, etc.)
- [x] Store acknowledgment templates in `scenarios/responses/acknowledgments.yaml`

**Files created/modified**:
- `scenarios/emotional_weight/task_weights.yaml` - Weight categories and triggers
- `scenarios/responses/acknowledgments.yaml` - Acknowledgment templates by category
- `src/utils/scenario_loader.py` - Added emotional weight and acknowledgment methods
- `src/models/risk_classifier.py` - Added `_assess_emotional_weight()` method
- `src/prompts/wellness_prompts.py` - Added `get_acknowledgment()` method
- `src/models/ai_wellness_guide.py` - Added `_add_acknowledgment_if_needed()` method

---

## Phase 2.5: Robustness & Classification Fixes ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Fix timeout issues, improve fallback handling, and expand domain classification accuracy.

### 2.5.1 Timeout & Fallback Fixes ✅ DONE
**Problem**: Practical tasks were timing out (30s limit too short for model loading + generation).

**Implementation**:
- [x] Dynamic timeout based on task type: 120s for practical, 45s for reflective
- [x] Mode-aware fallback responses (practical failures get "Technical issue" not "What's on your mind?")
- [x] Added practical fallback categories in `scenarios/responses/fallbacks.yaml`
- [x] Quick practical detection heuristic before try block for exception handling

**Files modified**:
- `src/models/ai_wellness_guide.py` - Dynamic timeout, mode-aware `_get_fallback_response()`
- `scenarios/responses/fallbacks.yaml` - Added `practical`, `practical_api_error`, `practical_empty` categories

### 2.5.2 Domain Classification Expansion ✅ DONE
**Problem**: "friend is addicted" was classified as `relationships` (matching "friend") instead of `health`.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Priority-based trigger matching: domains sorted by `risk_weight` (highest first)
- [x] Health domain expanded with 60+ new triggers:
  - Substance abuse: `addicted`, `addiction`, `cocaine`, `heroin`, `rehab`, `withdrawal`, `sober`, etc.
  - Mental health: `depression`, `anxiety`, `PTSD`, `trauma`, `eating disorder`, `psychiatrist`, etc.
  - Medical emergencies: `bleeding`, `ambulance`, `911`, `CPR`, `chest pain`, `seizure`, etc.
- [x] Crisis domain expanded with life-threatening triggers:
  - `she's dying`, `stopped breathing`, `heart stopped`, `losing too much blood`
- [x] Money domain expanded with gambling triggers
- [x] Relationships triggers made more specific (e.g., `friend` → `friend is upset`, `friendship problem`)
- [x] Spirituality triggers made more specific (e.g., `god` → `god told me`, `god's plan`)
- [x] Harmful triggers made more specific to avoid false positives (e.g., `rob` → `rob someone`)

**Files modified**:
- `src/utils/scenario_loader.py` - `get_all_triggers_flat()` now sorts by risk_weight
- `scenarios/domains/health.yaml` - Added 60+ triggers, `medical_emergency` redirect
- `scenarios/domains/crisis.yaml` - Added life-threatening emergency triggers, updated crisis response
- `scenarios/domains/money.yaml` - Added gambling triggers
- `scenarios/domains/relationships.yaml` - Made triggers contextual
- `scenarios/domains/spirituality.yaml` - Made triggers contextual
- `scenarios/domains/harmful.yaml` - Made triggers more specific (fixed "problem" → "harmful" bug)

### 2.5.3 New Domain Redirects ✅ DONE
- [x] `medical_emergency` - "Call 911 immediately" for bleeding/ambulance/emergency
- [x] `substance_abuse` - SAMHSA helpline redirect
- [x] `helping_someone_with_addiction` - Resources for families/friends
- [x] `mental_health_concern` - Professional support redirect
- [x] `crisis_adjacent` - 988 crisis line for suicidal thoughts
- [x] `gambling` - National Council on Problem Gambling

  - `code_help` (threshold: 10)
  - `explanations` (threshold: 12)
  - `writing_general` (threshold: 8)
  - `summarizing` (threshold: 6)
- [x] Each category includes:
  - Strong/medium pattern indicators for detection
  - Graduation prompts suggesting skill-building
  - Skill tips with practical frameworks
  - Celebration messages for independence
- [x] Graduation prompts are suggestions, never restrictions
- [x] User can dismiss with "just help me" and system respects it

### 4.1 Session Intent Check-In ✅ DONE
- [x] Add optional check-in at session start (not every time—configurable frequency)
- [x] Simple options:
  ```
  What brings you here?
  [ ] Get something done (practical)
  [ ] Think through something (processing)
  [ ] Just wanted to talk (connection-seeking)
  ```
- [x] "Just wanted to talk" triggers gentle reflection:
  - "I'm here to help with tasks, but I'm not great at just chatting. Is there someone you could reach out to? Or is there something specific on your mind?"
- [x] Configurable frequency (min sessions between, max days between)
- [x] Skip check-in if first message is clearly practical

### 4.2 Mid-Session Intent Shifts ✅ DONE
- [x] Detect when conversation shifts from practical to emotional mid-stream
- [x] Gentle acknowledgment: "It sounds like this became about more than just the email. Want to pause on the task and talk about what's coming up?"
- [x] User can choose: "No, just help with the email" or "Yeah, I need to think"

### 4.3 Connection-Seeking Detection ✅ DONE

---

## Phase 5: Enhanced Human Handoff ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Make the "bring someone in" feature more contextual and useful.

### 5.1 Context-Aware Templates ✅ DONE
- [x] Create `scenarios/handoff/contextual_templates.yaml` with context categories:
  - `after_difficult_task`: For high emotional weight tasks (resignation, apology, etc.)
  - `processing_decision`: When user is working through a decision
  - `after_sensitive_topic`: When conversation touched relationships, health, money, etc.
  - `high_usage_pattern`: When user is using the tool frequently
  - `general`: Default templates
- [x] Each category includes:
  - Intro prompts explaining why this handoff is suggested
  - Domain-specific message templates (e.g., health-specific for health topics)
  - Follow-up prompts for self-reporting
- [x] Auto-suggest relevant templates based on session content:
  - Detects emotional weight, session intent, domain, dependency score
  - Prioritizes templates by context relevance

### 5.2 Handoff Tracking ✅ DONE
- [x] Track (locally) when users initiate handoffs
- [x] Store handoff context (what triggered it, domain, person, message preview)
- [x] Optional self-report flow:
  - "Did you reach out?" (Yes / Not yet / Skip)
  - "How did it go?" (Really helpful / Somewhat helpful / Not very helpful)
- [x] Celebration messages for positive outcomes
- [x] Success metrics:
  - Reach-out rate (handoffs completed / initiated)
  - Helpful rate (helpful outcomes / total outcomes)
  - Health indicator (reach_out_rate >= 0.3 and helpful_rate >= 0.5)
- [x] Follow-up prompts with rate limiting (max 2/week, 24-hour delay)

**Files created/modified**:

- `tests/test_wellness_guide.py` - Added Phase 5 handoff tests

---

## Phase 6: Transparency & Explainability ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Show users exactly why the AI responded the way it did.

### 6.1 Decision Transparency Panel ✅ DONE
- [x] Add collapsible "Why this response?" section in UI
- [x] Show:
  ```
  Domain detected: logistics (practical task)
  Emotional weight: high (resignation-related)
  Mode: Practical + Acknowledgment
  Word limit: None
  Policy actions: None triggered
  ```
- [x] Helps users understand and trust the system
- [x] Auto-expands when policy action is triggered
- [x] Human-readable explanations for all domains, modes, and policies

### 6.2 Session Summary ✅ DONE
- [x] End-of-session summary (optional):
  ```
  This session:
  - 3 practical tasks completed
  - 1 topic touched sensitive domain (redirected)
  - Suggested human contact: Yes (work stress)
  - Time spent: 12 minutes
  ```
- [x] Exportable as JSON
- [x] Context-aware footer messages based on session type
- [x] "View Session Summary" button in sidebar

**Files created/modified**:
- `scenarios/transparency/explanations.yaml` - Domain, mode, policy, and risk explanations
- `src/utils/scenario_loader.py` - Added transparency configuration loading methods
- `src/app.py` - Added `display_transparency_panel()` and `display_session_summary()` functions
- `tests/test_wellness_guide.py` - Added 24 Phase 6 transparency tests

---

## Phase 6.5: Context Persistence ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Maintain emotional context across conversation turns so the system doesn't "forget" important context.

**Problem fixed**: User says "caught my boyfriend cheating, write me a breakup message" (reflection redirect triggers), then says "let's brainstorm" → system now maintains the emotional context and correctly applies reflection redirect.

### 6.5.1 Session Emotional Context ✅ DONE
- [x] Track emotional context at session level (not just per-message)
- [x] Store: `session_emotional_context` with highest emotional weight seen
- [x] Persist context for N turns after high-weight input detected
- [x] Example flow:
  ```
  User: "caught my boyfriend cheating" → session_context = {emotional_weight: "reflection_redirect", topic: "breakup"}
  User: "let's brainstorm" → system checks session_context, still applies reflection redirect
  ```

### 6.5.2 Topic Threading ✅ DONE
- [x] Track what the user is working on across turns via `topic_hint` extraction
- [x] Detect when a follow-up message relates to previous topic
- [x] Continuation detection via: short affirmatives, pronouns, continuation phrases, topic hints
- [x] Maintain topic thread until context decay or explicit topic change

### 6.5.3 Context Decay ✅ DONE
- [x] Context weight decays over turns (not instantly)
- [x] `reflection_redirect`: persists 7 turns (most sensitive)
- [x] `high_weight`: persists 5 turns
- [x] Sensitive domains: persists 4-6 turns
- [x] Context automatically clears on session reset

**Files modified**:
- `src/models/ai_wellness_guide.py` - Added `session_emotional_context`, `_update_session_context()`, `_get_context_adjusted_assessment()`, `_is_continuation_message()`, `_extract_topic_hints()`
- `tests/test_wellness_guide.py` - Added 22 context persistence tests

---

## Phase 7: Success Metrics (Local-First) ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Understand if EmpathySync is working without compromising privacy.

**IMPORTANT DISTINCTION**: We track SENSITIVE topic usage only, not overall usage.
- Practical tasks (email, code, explanations) = just using a tool, no judgment
- Sensitive topics (relationships, health, money, emotional support) = should decline over time

### 7.1 Local Metrics Dashboard ✅ DONE
- [x] Add "My Patterns" view in sidebar:
  ```
  This week vs Last Week:
  - Sensitive Topics: 3 ↓ (declining = success)
  - Connection Seeking: 1 ↓ (declining = success)
  - Human Reach-Outs: 2 ✓ ↑ (increasing = success)
  - Did It Myself: 3 ✓ ↑ (increasing = success)
  - Practical Tasks: 12 (neutral - just using a tool)
  ```
- [x] Trend indicators with appropriate direction (↓ for sensitive, ↑ for human connection)
- [x] Health status summary (healthy/moderate/concerning)

### 7.2 Optional Self-Report Moments ✅ DONE
- [x] Non-intrusive prompts with frequency limits (max 1/week, min 5 days between):
  - Handoff follow-up: "Did talking to someone help?"
  - Usage reflection: "You've brought personal topics here often. How are you feeling?"
- [x] All data local, user can delete anytime
- [x] Celebration messages for positive outcomes

### 7.3 Anti-Engagement Score (Sensitive Topics Only) ✅ DONE
- [x] Track SENSITIVE usage only (not practical tasks):
  - Sensitive sessions per week
  - Connection-seeking ratio
  - Late-night sensitive sessions
  - Week-over-week escalation
- [x] Score interpretation: 0-2 (Healthy), 2-4 (On Track), 4-6 (Worth Monitoring), 6-8 (High Reliance), 8-10 (Please Reach Out)
- [x] 30-day trend analysis with improving/stable/increasing indicators
- [x] Display: "Your reliance on AI for sensitive topics is decreasing. That's healthy growth."

**Files created/modified**:
- `scenarios/metrics/success_metrics.yaml` - Dashboard config, anti-engagement factors, self-report prompts
- `src/utils/wellness_tracker.py` - Added `get_sensitive_usage_stats()`, `get_weekly_comparison()`, `calculate_anti_engagement_score()`, `get_my_patterns_dashboard()`, self-report methods
- `src/utils/scenario_loader.py` - Added metrics config loading methods
- `src/app.py` - Added `display_my_patterns_dashboard()`, `display_self_report_prompt()`, "My Patterns" button
- `tests/test_wellness_guide.py` - Added 25+ Phase 7 tests

---

## Phase 8: Immunity Building & Wisdom Prompts ✅ COMPLETE (Core Features)
**Goal**: Train users to access their own wisdom and recognize unhealthy AI patterns.

### 8.1 "What Would You Tell a Friend?" Mode ✅ DONE
**High Impact** - Helps users access their own wisdom instead of depending on AI advice.

- [x] For `processing` intent or sensitive topic exploration, flip the question:
  ```
  "If a friend came to you with this exact situation, what would you tell them?"
  ```
- [x] Follow-up prompts:
  - "What advice would you give them?"
  - "Why do you think that advice feels right?"
  - "Could that same advice apply to you?"
- [x] Triggers:
  - User asks "what should I do?" on sensitive topics
  - `processing` intent detected
  - Relationship/money/health decisions
- [x] Creates self-reliance instead of AI-reliance

### 8.2 "Before You Send" Pause ✅ DONE
**High Impact** - Prevents regret on high-stakes messages.

- [x] For high-weight completed tasks, suggest waiting:
  ```
  "Here's your email. Consider sleeping on it before sending—these things often read differently in the morning."
  ```
- [x] Configurable delay suggestions (1 hour, overnight, 24 hours)
- [x] Category-specific pause prompts (resignation, difficult_conversation, apologies, etc.)
- [x] Applies to: resignation, difficult conversations, boundary-setting messages
- [x] Does NOT apply to: routine tasks, low-weight content

### 8.3 Reflection Journaling Alternative ✅ DONE
**High Impact** - Gives an outlet without creating dependency.

- [x] When redirecting from sensitive topics or reflection_redirect triggers, offer:
  ```
  "I won't draft this for you, but would you like to write it out for yourself first?
  Sometimes putting thoughts on paper helps—even if you never send it."
  ```
- [x] Provide journaling prompts:
  - "What do you actually want them to know?"
  - "How do you want to feel after this conversation?"
  - "What's the best possible outcome?"
- [x] Category-specific prompts (relationship, decision, apology, general)
- [x] User writes for themselves, not for AI to draft
- [ ] Optional: save journal entries locally (encrypted, user-controlled) - FUTURE

### 8.4 "Have You Talked to Someone?" Gate ✅ DONE
**High Impact** - Ensures human connection before AI engagement on heavy topics.

- [x] For high-stakes sensitive topics, ask first:
  ```
  "Have you talked to anyone you trust about this? [Yes / Not yet]"
  ```
- [x] If "Not yet":
  - Gently redirect to human connection first
  - Suggest specific people from trusted network
  - Offer to help them prepare for that conversation instead
- [x] If "Yes":
  - Proceed with appropriate restraint
  - Ask: "What did they think?"
- [x] Max asks per session (2) to avoid nagging
- [x] Applies to: major decisions, crisis-adjacent topics, relationship endings
- [x] Does NOT gate: practical tasks, general questions, low-stakes topics

### 8.5 AI Literacy Moments (Configuration Ready)
- [ ] Occasional (rare) educational prompts:
  - "Notice how I completed that task without asking how you feel? That's intentional. Some AIs would try to keep you talking."
  - "I just redirected you to a human. Other AIs might have kept going. Be wary of systems that never say 'talk to someone else.'"
- [ ] Max frequency: 1 per week, skippable

### 8.6 "Spot the Pattern" Feature
- [ ] Optional educational mode showing common manipulation patterns:
  - Flattery loops ("You're so insightful!")
  - Engagement hooks ("Tell me more about that...")
  - False intimacy ("I really care about you")
- [ ] Frame as: "Here's what to watch for in other AI tools"

---

## Phase 9: LLM-Based Intelligent Classification ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Replace brittle keyword matching with intelligent LLM-based classification using the existing Ollama model.

**Problem**: Current keyword matching is:
- Brittle: "the UK system is breaking down" triggers emotional distress markers
- Maintenance-heavy: Every edge case needs manual YAML updates
- Context-blind: Can't distinguish political "breaking down" from personal "I'm breaking down"

**Solution**: Use the same Ollama model that generates responses to classify intent first.

### 9.1 Classification Prompt Engineering ✅ DONE
- [x] Create `scenarios/classification/llm_classifier.yaml` with:
  - Classification prompt template
  - Expected JSON output schema
  - Domain definitions for the LLM
  - Example classifications for few-shot learning
- [x] Prompt asks model to return:
  ```json
  {
    "domain": "logistics|money|health|relationships|spirituality|crisis|harmful|emotional",
    "emotional_intensity": 0-10,
    "is_personal_distress": true|false,
    "topic_summary": "brief description",
    "confidence": 0-1
  }
  ```
- [x] Keep prompt concise (<500 tokens) to minimize latency

### 9.2 LLM Classifier Implementation ✅ DONE
- [x] Create `src/models/llm_classifier.py`:
  - `LLMClassifier` class with `classify()` method
  - Calls Ollama with classification prompt
  - Parses JSON response with error handling
  - Returns structured classification result
- [x] Timeout: 30s (allows for model cold-loading)
- [x] Temperature: 0.1 (deterministic classification)

### 9.3 Hybrid Classification System ✅ DONE
- [x] Modify `RiskClassifier` to use hybrid approach:
  - **Fast path**: Crisis/harmful keywords → immediate classification (safety-critical)
  - **Smart path**: LLM classification for everything else
  - **Fallback**: If LLM fails/times out → keyword matching
- [x] Configurable toggle in settings (`LLM_CLASSIFICATION_ENABLED`)
- [x] `classification_method` field in result shows which path was used

### 9.4 Classification Caching ✅ DONE
- [x] LRU cache for recent classifications (max 100 entries)
- [x] Cache key: hash of (message + recent_context)
- [x] TTL: 1 hour (configurable)
- [x] Reduces latency for follow-up messages on same topic

### 9.5 Quality Metrics (Partial)
- [x] Log confidence scores in classification result
- [ ] Optional: Track accuracy when keyword and LLM disagree (future)
- [ ] Optional: User feedback on misclassifications (future)

**Files created/modified**:
- `scenarios/classification/llm_classifier.yaml` - Prompt template, examples, fast-path patterns, cache config
- `src/models/llm_classifier.py` - LLMClassifier class with caching, JSON parsing, validation
- `src/models/risk_classifier.py` - Integrated hybrid classification with fallback
- `src/config/settings.py` - Added LLM_CLASSIFICATION_ENABLED setting
- `tests/test_llm_classifier.py` - Unit tests for LLM classifier

**Expected Improvement**:
| Scenario | Keyword Result | LLM Result |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| "UK system breaking down" | health (9.0) | logistics (2.0) ✓ |
| "I'm breaking down crying" | health (9.0) | emotional (9.0) ✓ |
| "My friend's dog died" | relationships | emotional (context-aware) ✓ |
| "Write code to kill the process" | harmful | logistics ✓ |

---

## Phase 9.1: Practical Technique Detection ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Allow full practical responses for "how to" questions in sensitive domains.

**Problem**: User asks "How do I read the Bible with childlike wonder?" - this is classified as `spirituality` domain, triggering Reflective Mode with brief responses and human redirect. But the user isn't asking for spiritual guidance - they're asking for practical reading techniques.

**Solution**: Add `is_practical_technique` field to LLM classification to distinguish:
- **Technique questions**: "How do I X?" → Practical Mode (full help)
- **Guidance questions**: "Should I X?" / "Is this right?" → Reflective Mode (restraint + redirect)

### 9.1.1 LLM Classifier Prompt Update ✅ DONE
- [x] Added `is_practical_technique` field to classification prompt template
- [x] Added clear guidance for distinguishing technique vs guidance questions
- [x] Added 12 cross-domain examples covering spirituality, health, money, relationships
- [x] Updated existing examples to include the new field

### 9.1.2 Classification Pipeline Update ✅ DONE
- [x] `LLMClassifier._validate_classification()` parses and normalizes `is_practical_technique`
- [x] Fast-path responses (crisis/harmful) set `is_practical_technique: false`
- [x] `RiskClassifier.classify()` passes through `is_practical_technique` from LLM result

### 9.1.3 Mode Selection Update ✅ DONE
- [x] `WellnessGuide.generate_response()` updated:
  ```python
  is_practical = domain == "logistics" or risk_assessment.get("is_practical_technique", False)
  ```
- [x] Added logging for practical technique detection in sensitive domains

**Cross-Domain Examples**:
| Domain | Technique Question (Practical Mode) | Guidance Question (Reflective Mode) |
|--------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Spirituality | "How do I meditate?" | "Is this God's calling for me?" |
| Health | "How do I do a proper squat?" | "Should I get this surgery?" |
| Money | "How do I create a budget?" | "Should I invest in crypto?" |
| Relationships | "How do I write a wedding toast?" | "Should I break up with them?" |

**Files modified**:
- `scenarios/classification/llm_classifier.yaml` - Added prompt guidance and 12 examples
- `src/models/llm_classifier.py` - Parse `is_practical_technique` field
- `src/models/risk_classifier.py` - Pass through field from LLM result
- `src/models/ai_wellness_guide.py` - Updated mode selection logic

---

### 9.5.5 UI Simplification ✅ DONE
- [x] Toggle behavior for sidebar panels (Reality Check, My People, My Patterns)
  - Click button again to close panel (no need for separate "Close" button)
  - Active panel shows with primary button styling
- [x] Remove Communication style selector (Gentle/Direct/Balanced)
  - System auto-adjusts based on detected domain
  - Reduces UI clutter without losing functionality
- [x] Fixed late-night warning to be pattern-based (2+ sessions, not single occurrence)

**Files modified**:
- `src/app.py` - Sidebar reorganization, button improvements, toggle behavior, CSS
- `scenarios/responses/base_prompt.yaml` - Added rule to prevent meta-commentary

---

## Phase 10: Advanced Detection (Long-term)
**Goal**: Further improve classification accuracy as local models improve.

### 10.1 Semantic Intent Detection
- [ ] When larger models run locally, use embeddings for:
  - Better intent classification
  - Topic drift detection
  - Emotional escalation prediction
- [ ] Keep keyword fallback for smaller models

### 10.2 Conversation Flow Analysis
- [ ] Track patterns across turns:
  - Practical → emotional shift detection
  - Repetitive question patterns (dependency signal)
  - Topic concentration (obsessive patterns)
- [ ] Use for proactive interventions

### 10.3 Model-Agnostic Safety Layer
- [ ] Safety checks that work regardless of model capability
- [ ] Hard-coded responses for crisis/harmful (never trust model)
- [ ] Fallback behaviors when model quality is low

---

## Phase 11: Persistence Hardening & Multi-Device Sync ✅ COMPLETE (Core)
**Goal**: Make data storage robust and enable safe multi-device usage.

**Deployment model**: Single user, multiple devices (laptop + desktop), one device active at a time.

### 11.1 Atomic JSON Writes ✅ DONE
**Problem**: Direct `json.dump()` can leave corrupted files on interrupted writes.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Write to temp file (`.wellness_data_*.tmp`) in same directory
- [x] Flush and fsync to ensure data hits disk
- [x] Atomic rename via `os.replace()` (POSIX-guaranteed atomic)
- [x] Corrupted file backup as `.corrupted.{timestamp}.json`
- [x] Proper exception handling (no bare `except:`)

**Files modified**:
- `src/utils/wellness_tracker.py` - Atomic `_save_data()`, improved `_load_data()`
- `src/utils/trusted_network.py` - Same pattern applied

### 11.2 Schema Versioning ✅ DONE
**Problem**: No way to migrate data when schema changes.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Add `schema_version` field to all data files
- [x] Migration functions run sequentially on load (v0→v1→v2...)
- [x] Old files auto-migrated, saved with new version
- [x] `_get_default_data()` centralizes default structure

**Current schema**: v1 (includes schema_version, all required fields)

### 11.3 SQLite Migration ✅ DONE
**Why**: Better transactions, partial updates, schema evolution, queryability.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Create SQLite schema with version table (`src/utils/database.py`)
- [x] Migration script: JSON → SQLite (`migrate_from_json()`)
- [x] WAL mode for crash safety (`PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`)
- [x] Checkpoint on clean shutdown (`checkpoint_for_sync()`)
- [x] Storage backend abstraction (`src/utils/storage_backend.py`)
- [x] Backward-compatible integration with WellnessTracker and TrustedNetwork

**Configuration**:
```bash
# Enable SQLite backend (default: false)
USE_SQLITE=true
```

**Files created**:
- `src/utils/database.py` - SQLite database layer with WAL, transactions, migrations
- `src/utils/storage_backend.py` - Unified interface for JSON/SQLite backends

**Files modified**:
- `src/utils/wellness_tracker.py` - Backend-aware operations
- `src/utils/trusted_network.py` - Backend-aware operations
- `src/config/settings.py` - Added USE_SQLITE setting

**Documentation**: See [docs/persistence.md](docs/persistence.md)

### 11.4 Lock File Mechanism ✅ DONE
**Why**: Prevent data conflicts when multiple devices sync.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Heartbeat-based lock (not PID-based) - stale detection via timestamp
- [x] Stale lock detection (configurable via `LOCK_STALE_TIMEOUT`)
- [x] UI warning when lock detected on another device
- [x] "Take Over" option for force access
- [x] Automatic heartbeat updates (60-second interval)
- [x] Clean release on app shutdown (via atexit)
- [x] Same-device lock re-entry (handles crash recovery gracefully)
- [x] Lock timeout now reads from `settings.LOCK_STALE_TIMEOUT` (not hardcoded)

**Configuration**:
```bash
# Enable device lock (default: false)
ENABLE_DEVICE_LOCK=true
# Stale timeout in seconds (default: 300)
LOCK_STALE_TIMEOUT=300
```

**Files created**:
- `src/utils/lockfile.py` - Lock file management with heartbeat

**Files modified**:
- `src/app.py` - Lock status check on startup, warning UI, read-only indicator in sidebar
- `src/config/settings.py` - Added ENABLE_DEVICE_LOCK, LOCK_STALE_TIMEOUT settings

### 11.5 Write Gate & Defense-in-Depth ✅ DONE
**Why**: Ensure no code path can accidentally write data when another device owns the lock.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Centralized write gate module (`src/utils/write_gate.py`)
- [x] All 31 storage backend write methods check `_ensure_write_allowed()` before executing
- [x] Checkpoint blocked in read-only mode (prevents modifying DB while another device writes)
- [x] "Writes blocked" indicator in sidebar when read-only
- [x] Defense layers: UI disabling → write gate flag → storage method checks
- [x] `WriteBlockedError` exception with user-friendly message

**Files created**:
- `src/utils/write_gate.py` - Centralized write permission control

**Files modified**:
- `src/utils/storage_backend.py` - Added write checks to all mutating methods
- `src/utils/database.py` - Checkpoint respects read-only mode
- `src/app.py` - Calls `set_read_only()` on lock status changes, sidebar indicator

### 11.6 SQLite Schema v2 ✅ DONE
**Why**: Cascade delete prevents orphaned reach_out records when a trusted person is removed.

**Implementation**:
- [x] `ON DELETE CASCADE` on reach_outs → trusted_people foreign key
- [x] Migration `_migrate_v1_to_v2()` for existing databases (table rebuild pattern)
- [x] `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` after migration to verify no FK violations
- [x] Schema version bumped to 2

### 11.7 Migration Gating Hardening ✅ DONE
**Why**: Prevent re-running JSON→SQLite migration if user has data in some tables but not others.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Migration checks for marker record in `schema_info` ("migrated from JSON")
- [x] Fallback check: any of 4 core tables has data
- [x] More robust than checking only `check_ins` count

### 11.8 Sync Folder Documentation → Moved to Phase 15.3

---

## Phase 12: Connection Building ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Help users with empty trusted networks find their people, instead of dead-ending at "talk to someone."

**Problem**: "Talk to someone" assumes you have someone. For users in the loneliness epidemic, that's not restraint — it's a dead end. The trusted network feature required *existing* relationships.

**Philosophy**: When someone has no network, shift the framing from "reach out to someone" to "let's think about where you might find your people." This is practical technique territory — full help allowed.

### 12.1 Signpost Categories ✅ DONE
**What**: Types of places to find connection — not specific services, just categories for users to search locally.

**Categories**:
- Community groups around shared interests (book clubs, sports, hobbies)
- Volunteering opportunities (food banks, community gardens)
- Support groups for shared experiences (grief, divorce, health conditions)
- Classes and skill-building (cooking, languages, fitness)
- Religious or spiritual communities (if that resonates)

**Domain-aware**: When user is dealing with specific topics (money, health, relationships, spirituality), show domain-relevant categories first.

**Files created**:
- `scenarios/connection_building/signposts.yaml` - Category definitions with search hints and "why it works" explanations

### 12.2 First-Contact Templates ✅ DONE
**What**: Practical guidance for *initiating* new connections (vs reaching out to existing contacts).

**Situations covered**:
- Starting a conversation at a group or meetup
- Moving an acquaintance toward friendship
- Reconnecting with someone from the past
- Joining a new community
- Asking someone for help (even if not close)

**Includes**:
- Conversation starters with "why it works" explanations
- Templates for suggesting hanging out
- Tips for handling rejection
- General principles (consistency beats intensity, shared activities > forced conversation)
- Affirmations for people who find this hard

**Files created**:
- `scenarios/connection_building/first_contact.yaml` - Situation-specific templates and tips

### 12.3 "Building Your Network" Mode ✅ DONE
**What**: Enhanced UI for users with empty trusted networks.

**Behavior**:
- When network is empty, show tabbed interface instead of just "add someone"
- Tab 1: "Where to Look" — signpost categories with expandable details
- Tab 2: "Making First Contact" — situation-specific templates
- Tab 3: "Add Someone" — the existing add form (for when they already have someone in mind)

**Integration points**:
- Main chat area: Shown when network empty (instead of simple "set up network" button)
- Sidebar "My People" button: Shows Building Your Network when empty, regular setup when populated
- Context-aware: Uses current conversation domain to surface relevant signposts

**Files modified**:
- `src/utils/scenario_loader.py` - Added connection_building directory loading
- `src/utils/trusted_network.py` - Added `is_network_empty()`, `get_signposts()`, `get_first_contact_templates()`, `get_building_network_content()`
- `src/app.py` - Added `display_building_your_network()` function, updated empty network handling

---

## Phase 13: Project Health & Stability ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Fix known issues and ensure the app fails gracefully when dependencies are missing.

**Why now**: 6 tests were failing, `.env.example` was incomplete, and if Ollama wasn't running the user got a cryptic error after 30 seconds. These are table stakes before anyone else touches the project.

### 13.1 Fix Failing Tests ✅ DONE
**Problem**: 6 of 314 tests were failing due to edge cases in test fixtures and assertions.

**Root causes found and fixed**:
- `test_detect_domain_spirituality` — missing triggers `praying to god` and `praying for guidance` in spirituality.yaml
- `test_classify_crisis_input` — LLM fast-path returns intensity 10.0 (correct), test expected keyword-only 9.0. Fixed assertion to accept >= 9.0
- `test_generate_response_handles_api_error` — fallback response randomly selected from list, test only matched one option. Fixed to accept any valid fallback
- `test_anti_engagement_score_empty` / `test_anti_engagement_ignores_practical` — **mock target bug**: `patch("config.settings.settings")` didn't reach `wellness_tracker.py` because it imports settings directly. Fixed to `patch("utils.wellness_tracker.settings")` + changed `return` to `yield` to keep mock active during test
- `test_get_self_report_history` — same mock target bug, fixed with same pattern
- Additionally fixed `test_get_friend_mode_flip_prompt` and `test_safe_alternative_response_is_helpful` (flaky random selection assertions)

**Result**: 323/323 tests passing (314 original + 9 new health check tests)

**Files modified**:
- `scenarios/domains/spirituality.yaml` — Added `praying to god`, `praying for guidance` triggers
- `tests/test_wellness_guide.py` — Fixed 8 test assertions, fixed 4 mock fixtures (correct patch target + yield)

### 13.2 Ollama Health Check ✅ DONE
**Problem**: If Ollama isn't running or the model isn't downloaded, the user sees "Technical issue" after a 30-second timeout. No guidance on how to fix it.

**Implementation**:
- [x] On app startup, ping Ollama API (`/api/tags` endpoint)
- [x] If Ollama unreachable: show clear error with install instructions
- [x] If Ollama running but model missing: show which models are available, suggest `ollama pull` command
- [x] If Ollama running and model ready: proceed normally
- [x] Health checks run once per session (cached in `st.session_state`)

### 13.3 Startup Validation ✅ DONE
**Problem**: Multiple dependencies and settings can be misconfigured. Users discover issues mid-session, not at startup.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Validate all required environment variables on startup (existing `validate_environment()`)
- [x] Check data directory exists and is writable
- [x] Verify SQLite database is accessible (if USE_SQLITE=true)
- [x] Show validation results — green for pass, red for critical failure
- [x] Block on critical failures, allow non-critical warnings
- [x] 9 tests covering all health check scenarios

**Files created**:
- `src/utils/health_check.py` — `HealthStatus` dataclass, individual check functions, `run_health_checks()`, `has_critical_failures()`

**Files modified**:
- `src/app.py` — Integrated health checks into `main()` before session initialization

### 13.4 Complete .env.example ✅ DONE
**Problem**: `.env.example` was missing Phase 11 settings (USE_SQLITE, ENABLE_DEVICE_LOCK, LOCK_STALE_TIMEOUT). New users wouldn't know these options exist.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Added Storage Backend section with USE_SQLITE
- [x] Added Multi-Device Sync section with ENABLE_DEVICE_LOCK, LOCK_STALE_TIMEOUT
- [x] Added comments explaining when/why to enable each option

---

## Phase 14: Packaging & Distribution ✅ COMPLETE (Core)
**Goal**: Make empathySync installable by developers without reading the source code.

**Why now**: The product was ready but nobody could use it. There was no path from "interested person" to "running the app" without significant technical knowledge. A developer landing on the repo should be able to run it in under 5 minutes.

### 14.1 Create pyproject.toml ✅ DONE
**Problem**: No standard Python packaging. Can't `pip install .` or `pip install empathysync`.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Created `pyproject.toml` with project metadata, dependencies, and entry points
- [x] Defined `[project.scripts]` entry point: `empathysync = "src.cli:main"`
- [x] Created `src/cli.py` — launches Streamlit via subprocess
- [x] Core dependencies trimmed from 15 to 4 (removed unused aspirational deps)
- [x] Added `[project.optional-dependencies]` dev extras (pytest, black, flake8, mypy)
- [x] Added `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` with pythonpath for cleaner test runs
- [x] Verified `pip install -e ".[dev]"` works
- [x] Cleaned `requirements.txt` to match actual imports (streamlit, requests, python-dotenv, pyyaml)

**Files created**:
- `pyproject.toml` — Package metadata, dependencies, entry points, tool config
- `src/cli.py` — CLI entry point for `empathysync` command

### 14.2 Installation Script ✅ DONE
**Problem**: Setup required multiple manual steps (clone, create venv, install deps, copy .env, check Ollama).

**Implementation**:
- [x] Created `install.sh` for Linux/Mac one-command setup:
  - Checks Python version (>=3.9)
  - Creates virtual environment
  - Installs dependencies
  - Copies `.env.example` to `.env` if not present
  - Checks if Ollama is installed and running
  - Lists available models with sizes
  - Prints "Ready to run" message with launch command
- [x] Color-coded output ([OK], [WARN], [FAIL])

**Files created**:
- `install.sh` — One-command setup script

### 14.3 Docker Compose ✅ DONE
**Problem**: Running empathySync required Ollama installed separately. Docker Compose bundles both.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Written working `Dockerfile` (Python 3.12 slim, 4 deps only)
- [x] Created `docker-compose.yml` with two services:
  - `ollama`: Ollama server with health check and persistent volume
  - `app`: empathySync Streamlit app, waits for healthy Ollama
- [x] Volume mount for `data/` directory (user data persists)
- [x] `.env` file mounted read-only
- [x] `OLLAMA_HOST` automatically set to container network address
- [x] Health checks for both services
- [x] `.dockerignore` to keep image small

**Files created**:
- `Dockerfile` — App container image
- `docker-compose.yml` — Two-service orchestration
- `.dockerignore` — Excludes venv, tests, git, data from image

### 14.4 Tag v0.9-beta Release ✅ DONE
**Problem**: No releases, no changelog. Contributors and users have no sense of project maturity.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Create CHANGELOG.md summarizing all phases
- [x] Tag `v0.9-beta` as first official release
- [x] Create GitHub Release with:
  - Summary of what's included (14 completed phases)
  - Installation instructions (3 methods: install.sh, pip, Docker)
  - Known limitations
  - Link to MANIFESTO.md
- [x] Update README badges (version, tests passing, license)

---

## Phase 15: CI/CD & Documentation ✅ COMPLETE (Core)
**Goal**: Make the project contributor-friendly and self-maintaining.

**Why now**: Any contributor landing on the repo should see: tests pass automatically, code style is enforced, and common issues are documented. This is what separates "personal project" from "open source project."

### 15.1 GitHub Actions CI ✅ DONE
**Problem**: No automated testing. Changes can break things silently. Contributors can't verify their changes pass without manual test runs.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
  - Trigger on push and pull request to main
  - Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 matrix
  - Install dependencies
  - Run `black --check src/` (formatting)
  - Run `flake8 src/` (linting)
  - Run `pytest tests/` (tests)
- [x] Add "Tests Passing" badge to README
- [x] MANIFESTO.md protection:
  - CI job (`manifesto-guard`) blocks any PR that modifies MANIFESTO.md
  - CODEOWNERS requires owner review as second layer
  - Error message quotes the Living Clause: "evolves only to tighten, never to weaken"

### 15.2 Troubleshooting Guide ✅ DONE
**Problem**: Common issues (Ollama not running, database locked, model too slow) have no documented solutions. Users hit a wall and give up.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Create `docs/troubleshooting.md` covering:
  - "Ollama not responding" — install, start, verify
  - "Model not found" — download commands for recommended models by RAM
  - "Database locked" — lock file explanation, force takeover
  - "Slow responses" — model size vs hardware, LLM classification toggle
  - "App won't start" — dependency check, Python version, .env validation
  - "Data corruption" — backup recovery, SQLite integrity check, schema migration
  - "Docker issues" — container health, model pulling, port conflicts
- [x] Link to issue tracker for unresolved problems

### 15.3 Sync Folder Documentation ✅ DONE
> **Note**: Moved from Phase 11.8. Covers multi-device sync setup.

**Problem**: Phase 11 added lock file and multi-device support, but there's no user guide for setting it up with Syncthing, Dropbox, or similar tools.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Create `docs/sync-setup.md`:
  - Syncthing configuration with `.stignore` patterns
  - Dropbox/iCloud/OneDrive path examples
  - Operating rules: "Close app before switching devices"
  - What happens if you forget (lock file protection, read-only mode)
  - Troubleshooting conflict files
  - SQLite vs JSON comparison for sync
- [x] Updated `docs/persistence.md` to link to sync guide

**Files created**:
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` — User-facing troubleshooting guide
- `docs/sync-setup.md` — Multi-device sync setup guide

**Files modified**:
- `docs/persistence.md` — Updated sync docs status

---

## Phase 16: Core Decoupling & Interface Abstraction ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Extract a `ConversationSession` class that owns all session state, so any interface (Streamlit, CLI, messaging adapter) can drive the conversation engine. This is the **"soul as a library"** milestone (Project Goal #2).

**Why now**: The core engine (`WellnessGuide`, `RiskClassifier`, `WellnessPrompts`, `StorageBackend`, `WellnessTracker`, `TrustedNetwork`, `ScenarioLoader`) is already ~80% framework-agnostic. Only `st.session_state` usage in `app.py` and UI display functions are tightly coupled to Streamlit. This makes decoupling a realistic extraction task, not a rewrite.

**Sibling project**: [IntentKeeper](https://github.com/Olawoyin007) (planned) — an AI content filter that classifies content by energy/intent (ragebait, hype, fear, genuine insight). IntentKeeper will reuse the classification pipeline patterns extracted in this phase. empathySync's `RiskClassifier` architecture (input → detect intent → score → act) is the template for IntentKeeper's content classifier. The decoupling here directly enables that reuse.

### 16.1 Extract ConversationSession Class ✅ DONE
**Problem**: Session state (turns, domains, risk history, post-crisis state, emotional context) is scattered across `st.session_state` in `app.py`. This makes it impossible to drive the conversation engine from any interface other than Streamlit.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Create `src/models/conversation_session.py`:
  - Encapsulates all per-session state (turns, domains visited, max risk, post-crisis turn, emotional context)
  - Owns the conversation loop: receive input → classify → generate → safety-check → return
  - Exposes structured events (transparency info, policy actions, handoff suggestions) as return values, not UI calls
- [x] Create `src/models/conversation_result.py` — structured dataclass for `process_message()` return value
- [x] Move session state initialization out of `app.py` into `ConversationSession.__init__()`
- [x] Move conversation orchestration into `ConversationSession.process_message()`
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass (360/360 including 15 new streaming tests)

### 16.2 Define InterfaceAdapter Protocol ✅ DONE
**Problem**: No formal contract between the conversation engine and its UI. Adding a new interface means duplicating the entire `app.py` flow.

**Implementation**:
- [x] Create `src/interfaces/adapter.py` with `InterfaceAdapter` protocol:
  - `render_result(result) → None` — render conversation result
  - `prompt_intent_shift(shift_info) → bool` — handle intent shift interaction
  - `prompt_graduation(category, prompt_text) → str` — handle graduation interaction
- [x] Protocol is minimal — adapters can ignore optional methods

### 16.3 Refactor app.py to StreamlitAdapter ✅ DONE
- [x] Refactor `app.py` to use `ConversationSession` for conversation orchestration
- [x] `display_chat_interface()` reduced to thin rendering wrapper
- [x] Session state keys (`session_intent`, `pending_shift`, `acknowledged_shift`, `pending_graduation`, `graduation_shown_this_session`, `last_task_category`) moved from `st.session_state` to `ConversationSession`
- [x] All display functions updated to read from `conversation_session` instead of `st.session_state`
- [x] Verify: identical behavior, all 323 tests pass

### 16.4 CLIAdapter Proof-of-Concept ✅ DONE
- [x] Create `src/interfaces/cli_adapter.py` implementing `InterfaceAdapter`
- [x] Simple terminal interface: `input()` → `process_message()` → `print()`
- [x] Transparency info shown as plain text below responses
- [x] Validates that the abstraction works for a second interface
- [x] Update `src/cli.py` to offer both Streamlit and direct CLI modes (`--mode web|cli`)

### 16.5 Streaming Support ✅ DONE
- [x] `generate_response_stream()` in WellnessGuide yields tokens progressively
- [x] `_call_ollama_stream()` handles Ollama streaming API
- [x] `process_message_stream()` + `finalize_stream()` in ConversationSession
- [x] CLI streaming: `sys.stdout.write(chunk)` + flush per token
- [x] Streamlit streaming: `st.write_stream()` for progressive display
- [x] Pre-LLM safety pipeline runs synchronously before streaming
- [x] Crisis/harmful responses return complete immediately (no streaming)
- [x] 15 new streaming tests added

**Files created**:
- `src/models/conversation_session.py` — Framework-agnostic session management
- `src/models/conversation_result.py` — Structured result dataclass
- `src/interfaces/adapter.py` — InterfaceAdapter protocol definition
- `src/interfaces/streamlit_adapter.py` — Streamlit implementation
- `src/interfaces/cli_adapter.py` — Terminal implementation

**Files modified**:
- `src/app.py` — Refactored `display_chat_interface()` to use ConversationSession
- `src/cli.py` — Added `--mode` argument for web/cli selection

---

## Phase 16.5: Type Safety & Data Contracts 🔧 HARDENING
**Goal**: Replace fragile dicts and string constants with typed structures throughout the codebase.

**Why now**: Risk assessments, classification results, and session summaries are all passed around as plain dicts. A single misspelled key (`"emotinal_weight"` vs `"emotional_weight"`) silently produces `None` instead of crashing. Enums and dataclasses catch these at definition time, not at 2 AM in production.

### 16.5.1 Enums for Domain Constants
**Problem**: 100+ string comparisons like `domain == "logistics"`, `domain == "health"`, `intent == "processing"` scattered across all core files. Typos compile fine and fail silently.

**Files affected**:
- `src/models/risk_classifier.py` — domain comparisons throughout (`"logistics"`, `"health"`, `"crisis"`, `"harmful"`, `"emotional"`, etc.)
- `src/models/ai_wellness_guide.py` — domain checks in mode selection, acknowledgment logic, context adjustment
- `src/models/llm_classifier.py` — domain validation in `_validate_classification()`
- `src/utils/wellness_tracker.py` — domain keys in usage stats, anti-engagement scoring
- `src/utils/scenario_loader.py` — domain keys when loading YAML configs

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create `src/models/enums.py` with:
  - `Domain` enum: `LOGISTICS`, `HEALTH`, `CRISIS`, `HARMFUL`, `EMOTIONAL`, `RELATIONSHIPS`, `MONEY`, `SPIRITUALITY`
  - `Intent` enum: `PRACTICAL`, `PROCESSING`, `CONNECTION_SEEKING`
  - `EmotionalWeight` enum: `HIGH_WEIGHT`, `MEDIUM_WEIGHT`, `LOW_WEIGHT`, `REFLECTION_REDIRECT`
  - `ClassificationMethod` enum: `LLM`, `KEYWORD`, `FAST_PATH`, `FALLBACK`
  - `Action` enum: `BLUR`, `TAG`, `HIDE`, `PASS`
- [ ] Replace all string literal comparisons with enum members
- [ ] Update YAML loading to map string values → enum members at load time
- [ ] Update all tests to use enum members

### 16.5.2 Dataclasses for Structured State
**Problem**: Risk assessments, classification results, and session summaries are dicts with 8-15 keys each. No IDE autocomplete, no type checking, no documentation of required vs optional fields.

**Specific dict patterns to replace** (20+ instances):
- `risk_classifier.py` — `classify()` returns dict with `domain`, `emotional_intensity`, `dependency_risk`, `risk_weight`, `is_personal_distress`, `emotional_weight`, `emotional_weight_score`, `is_practical_technique`, `classification_method`, `confidence`
- `llm_classifier.py` — `classify()` returns dict with `domain`, `emotional_intensity`, `is_personal_distress`, `topic_summary`, `confidence`, `is_practical_technique`
- `wellness_tracker.py` — session summaries as dicts with `session_id`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `turns`, `domains_visited`, `max_risk`, `handoffs`, `graduation_prompts`
- `ai_wellness_guide.py` — transparency info dicts with `domain`, `mode`, `emotional_weight`, `policy_actions`, `word_limit`

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create `src/models/data_contracts.py` with:
  - `@dataclass RiskAssessment` — typed fields for all risk classifier output
  - `@dataclass LLMClassification` — typed fields for LLM classifier output
  - `@dataclass SessionSummary` — typed fields for session summary data
  - `@dataclass TransparencyInfo` — typed fields for decision explanation
- [ ] Replace `dict` returns with dataclass instances in `RiskClassifier.classify()`
- [ ] Replace `dict` returns with dataclass instances in `LLMClassifier.classify()`
- [ ] Update all consumers to use attribute access instead of `dict.get()`
- [ ] Add `__post_init__` validation where appropriate (e.g., `confidence` must be 0.0-1.0)

### 16.5.3 Type Annotations Audit
- [ ] Add return type annotations to all public methods in core modules
- [ ] Add parameter type annotations where missing
- [ ] Run `mypy --strict` on `src/models/` and `src/utils/` and fix errors
- [ ] Add `mypy` to CI pipeline (`pyproject.toml` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

---

## Phase 16.6: Async I/O & Performance 🔧 HARDENING
**Goal**: Eliminate synchronous blocking calls, pre-compile hot-path patterns, and optimize O(n²) algorithms.

**Why now**: Every Ollama call currently blocks the main thread via synchronous `requests.post()`. In the Streamlit single-threaded model this freezes the entire UI. When Phase 17 adds a background daemon processing nudges and scheduled tasks, blocking I/O will be a hard blocker.

### 16.6.1 Replace `requests` with `httpx` Async
**Problem**: `requests.post()` blocks the event loop. Three call sites make synchronous HTTP calls to Ollama:
- `src/models/ai_wellness_guide.py:914,949` — `_call_ollama()` and `_call_ollama_stream()`
- `src/models/llm_classifier.py:308` — `_call_ollama()` for classification

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Add `httpx>=0.26.0` to dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Create shared `httpx.AsyncClient` with connection pooling (single instance per session)
- [ ] Convert `WellnessGuide._call_ollama()` to async with `httpx.AsyncClient.post()`
- [ ] Convert `WellnessGuide._call_ollama_stream()` to async streaming
- [ ] Convert `LLMClassifier._call_ollama()` to async
- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff (1 retry, 2s delay) for transient failures
- [ ] Inject `http_client` parameter for testability (same pattern as IntentKeeper)
- [ ] Remove `requests` from `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`

### 16.6.2 Pre-Compile Regular Expressions
**Problem**: Regex patterns compiled inside hot-path methods — every classification call re-compiles the same patterns.

**File**: `src/models/llm_classifier.py:195-206` — 6+ regex patterns compiled per call in `_extract_json_from_response()`

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Move all `re.compile()` calls to module-level constants
- [ ] Create `_PATTERNS` dict at module level with pre-compiled patterns:
  - JSON extraction patterns
  - Whitespace normalization patterns
  - Response cleanup patterns
- [ ] Same treatment for `risk_classifier.py` trigger matching patterns
- [ ] Benchmark before/after (expect ~10x speedup on pattern matching)

### 16.6.3 Aho-Corasick for Trigger Matching
**Problem**: Trigger detection iterates every trigger for every domain — O(n×m) where n = input tokens and m = total triggers across all domains. With 200+ triggers across 8 domains, this is measurably slow.

**File**: `src/models/risk_classifier.py:241-248` — nested loops over domains and triggers

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Add `ahocorasick` or `pyahocorasick` to dependencies
- [ ] Build Aho-Corasick automaton at `RiskClassifier.__init__()` from all domain triggers
- [ ] Single-pass multi-pattern match: input → all matching triggers → group by domain
- [ ] Falls back to current linear scan if `ahocorasick` not installed (optional dependency)
- [ ] Cache automaton — rebuild only when scenario YAML is reloaded

### 16.6.4 Batch Processing Optimization
- [ ] `classify_batch()` in LLMClassifier should use `asyncio.gather()` (currently sequential)
- [ ] Connection pool size configurable (default: 5 concurrent Ollama calls)
- [ ] Backpressure: queue overflow → reject with clear error, don't OOM

---

## Phase 16.7: Security Hardening 🔧 HARDENING
**Goal**: Fix race conditions, remove hardcoded secrets, close injection vectors, and add input validation.

**Why now**: These are latent vulnerabilities. The lock file race condition can corrupt data under multi-device sync. The SQL injection vector in `storage_backend.py` is exploitable if user-controlled data ever reaches dynamic queries. Hardcoded secrets in `.env` will ship to forks.

### 16.7.1 Atomic Lock File Operations
**Problem**: `lockfile.py` uses a read-then-write pattern for lock acquisition — two processes can both read "unlocked" and both write their lock, causing a silent conflict.

**File**: `src/utils/lockfile.py` — `acquire()` method

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Replace read-then-write with atomic `os.open()` using `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` flags (POSIX atomic create-or-fail)
- [ ] On Windows, use `msvcrt.locking()` or `fcntl.flock()` equivalent
- [ ] Add integration test: two threads race to acquire lock, exactly one succeeds
- [ ] Heartbeat update also needs atomic write (write to temp + `os.replace()`)

### 16.7.2 Remove Hardcoded Secrets
**Problem**: `.env` file contains actual secret values that ship with the repository.

**File**: `.env` — lines 10 and 35 contain hardcoded secret/key values

**Implementation**:
- [ ] `.env` must be in `.gitignore` (verify it is)
- [ ] `.env.example` should have placeholder values only (`SECRET_KEY=change-me-to-a-random-string`)
- [ ] Add startup validation: if `SECRET_KEY == "change-me-to-a-random-string"`, fail with clear error in production
- [ ] Add `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` as auto-generated default for development mode
- [ ] Audit all settings for values that should never be committed

### 16.7.3 SQL Injection Prevention
**Problem**: `storage_backend.py` builds some queries with string formatting on column names. If any column name is derived from user input, this is exploitable.

**File**: `src/utils/storage_backend.py` — dynamic query construction

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Audit every SQL query in `database.py` and `storage_backend.py` for string interpolation
- [ ] Column names: validate against a whitelist of known columns before interpolation
- [ ] Values: ensure ALL values go through parameterized queries (`?` placeholders), never f-strings
- [ ] Add `_VALID_COLUMNS` frozenset per table, raise `ValueError` on unknown column names
- [ ] Add SQL injection test: attempt to pass `"; DROP TABLE check_ins; --"` as a column name

### 16.7.4 Rate Limiting
**Problem**: No rate limiting on any API endpoint or Ollama call. A runaway loop or malicious client can overwhelm the local Ollama instance.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Add per-session rate limit: max N classifications per minute (configurable, default: 20)
- [ ] Add global rate limit for Ollama calls: max N concurrent calls (default: 3)
- [ ] Token bucket or sliding window implementation (no external dependencies)
- [ ] Rate limit exhaustion returns clear error message, not silent failure
- [ ] Rate limit config in `settings.py`

### 16.7.5 Input Length Validation
**Problem**: No consistent input length limits. Very long messages can cause Ollama OOM or extremely slow classification.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Define `MAX_INPUT_LENGTH` constant (e.g., 5000 characters)
- [ ] Validate in `WellnessGuide.generate_response()` before any processing
- [ ] Validate in `LLMClassifier.classify()` before Ollama call
- [ ] Truncate gracefully with user notification (don't silently drop content)
- [ ] Add to UI: character counter on input field

---

## Phase 16.8: God Class Decomposition 🔧 HARDENING
**Goal**: Break the 5 largest classes into focused, single-responsibility components.

**Why now**: The god classes are the single biggest barrier to contribution. A new contributor facing a 1646-line class with 40+ methods will bounce. Decomposition makes the codebase navigable, testable, and reviewable.

### 16.8.1 Decompose WellnessTracker (1646 lines, 40+ methods)
**File**: `src/utils/wellness_tracker.py`

**Problem**: Tracks check-ins, task patterns, independence, handoffs, self-reports, anti-engagement scores, session metrics, and dashboard data — all in one class.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Extract `TaskPatternTracker` — task category detection, graduation eligibility, independence logging
- [ ] Extract `HandoffTracker` — handoff events, follow-ups, success metrics
- [ ] Extract `AntiEngagementScorer` — sensitive usage stats, weekly comparison, reliance scoring
- [ ] Extract `SessionMetrics` — session summaries, turn tracking, domain visit logging
- [ ] Keep `WellnessTracker` as a thin facade delegating to the above
- [ ] Each component gets its own file in `src/utils/tracking/`
- [ ] Move shared types to `src/models/data_contracts.py`

### 16.8.2 Decompose WellnessGuide (1478 lines, 30+ methods)
**File**: `src/models/ai_wellness_guide.py`

**Problem**: Handles Ollama communication, response generation, prompt building, context management, acknowledgment logic, safety pipeline, and streaming — all in one class.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Extract `OllamaClient` — HTTP calls, retry logic, streaming, health check
- [ ] Extract `ResponsePipeline` — pre-generation safety checks, post-generation adjustments, acknowledgment injection
- [ ] Extract `ContextManager` — session emotional context, topic threading, context decay
- [ ] Keep `WellnessGuide` as orchestrator calling the above
- [ ] Each component gets its own file in `src/models/`

### 16.8.3 Decompose ScenarioLoader (1375 lines, 25+ methods)
**File**: `src/utils/scenario_loader.py`

**Problem**: Loads domains, intents, graduation, handoff, emotional weight, metrics, transparency, connection building, and classification configs — all from one class.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Extract `DomainLoader` — domain YAML loading, trigger indexing, risk weight lookup
- [ ] Extract `ResponseLoader` — fallbacks, acknowledgments, handoff templates
- [ ] Extract `ClassificationConfigLoader` — LLM classifier config, few-shot examples
- [ ] Keep `ScenarioLoader` as a registry/facade
- [ ] Use `@functools.lru_cache` on individual loaders (currently no caching at loader level)

### 16.8.4 Decompose StorageBackend (1368 lines, 31+ methods)
**File**: `src/utils/storage_backend.py`

**Problem**: Unified interface for JSON and SQLite backends, handling check-ins, trusted people, reach-outs, handoff events, self-reports, independence, task patterns, and session intents.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Extract interface `StorageProtocol` (Python Protocol class) defining the full contract
- [ ] Extract `CheckInStorage` — check-in CRUD operations
- [ ] Extract `TrustedNetworkStorage` — trusted people + reach-outs
- [ ] Extract `MetricsStorage` — handoff events, self-reports, independence, task patterns
- [ ] Each storage component has JSON and SQLite implementations
- [ ] `StorageBackend` becomes a composite delegating to components

### 16.8.5 Simplify RiskClassifier (778 lines)
**File**: `src/models/risk_classifier.py`

**Problem**: Handles domain detection, emotional weight assessment, dependency scoring, intent detection, task category detection, graduation info, and crisis/harmful fast-path — too many concerns.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Extract `EmotionalWeightAssessor` — weight detection, score calculation
- [ ] Extract `DependencyScorer` — dependency risk calculation, pattern analysis
- [ ] Extract `TaskCategoryDetector` — task category detection, graduation eligibility
- [ ] Keep `RiskClassifier` as orchestrator for the overall classification pipeline

---

## Phase 16.9: Test Coverage Expansion 🔧 HARDENING
**Goal**: Cover the 6 untested files, add error injection tests, concurrency tests, and security tests.

**Why now**: 292 tests is impressive, but zero coverage on `database.py`, `storage_backend.py`, `lockfile.py`, `write_gate.py`, `trusted_network.py`, and `helpers.py` means the persistence layer — the layer that owns user data — is completely unguarded. Any refactoring in Phase 16.8 without tests is playing with fire.

### 16.9.1 Storage Layer Tests
**Problem**: `database.py` (SQLite operations) and `storage_backend.py` (unified interface) have zero test coverage. These handle all user data persistence.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create `tests/test_database.py`:
  - Schema creation and migration (v1→v2)
  - CRUD operations for each table (check_ins, trusted_people, reach_outs, etc.)
  - WAL mode verification
  - Checkpoint behavior
  - Transaction rollback on error
  - Concurrent read/write behavior
- [ ] Create `tests/test_storage_backend.py`:
  - JSON backend: read, write, atomic save, corruption recovery
  - SQLite backend: same operations via storage abstraction
  - Backend switching (JSON → SQLite migration)
  - Write gate integration (blocked writes raise `WriteBlockedError`)

### 16.9.2 Lock File & Write Gate Tests
**Problem**: `lockfile.py` and `write_gate.py` have zero coverage. These are the multi-device safety net.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create `tests/test_lockfile.py`:
  - Lock acquisition and release
  - Stale lock detection (mock time)
  - Heartbeat update
  - Concurrent acquisition (two threads, one wins)
  - Lock re-entry from same device
  - Force takeover behavior
- [ ] Create `tests/test_write_gate.py`:
  - Write allowed/blocked state transitions
  - `WriteBlockedError` raised on blocked writes
  - All 31 storage write methods respect the gate

### 16.9.3 Trusted Network Tests
**Problem**: `trusted_network.py` has zero direct test coverage. Handles the human connection features.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create `tests/test_trusted_network.py`:
  - Add/remove trusted people
  - Reach-out logging and history
  - Context-aware handoff template selection
  - Network empty detection
  - Signpost and first-contact template retrieval
  - Building network content generation

### 16.9.4 Error Injection Tests
**Problem**: No tests verify behavior under adverse conditions (disk full, Ollama crash mid-stream, corrupt JSON, database locked).

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Ollama errors: connection refused, timeout, malformed JSON, empty response, HTTP 500
- [ ] Storage errors: disk full (mock `os.replace` raising `OSError`), corrupt JSON file, locked SQLite database
- [ ] YAML errors: missing files, malformed YAML, missing required keys
- [ ] All error paths should fail open (neutral/safe behavior, never crash)

### 16.9.5 Concurrency Tests
**Problem**: No tests verify thread safety of shared state (cache, session state, lock files).

**Implementation**:
- [ ] LLM classification cache: concurrent reads/writes don't corrupt
- [ ] WellnessTracker: concurrent `_save_data()` calls produce valid JSON
- [ ] Lock file: race condition test (two threads attempt simultaneous acquisition)
- [ ] Session state: concurrent `process_message()` calls are serialized

### 16.9.6 Security Tests
- [ ] SQL injection attempts on all storage methods
- [ ] Oversized input handling (10MB message)
- [ ] Special characters in all user-facing inputs (Unicode, null bytes, control characters)
- [ ] Lock file path traversal attempts

---

## Phase 16.10: Observability & Configuration 🔧 HARDENING
**Goal**: Add structured logging, extract magic numbers to config, and validate configuration at startup.

**Why now**: 50+ magic numbers are scattered as bare literals. When a contributor needs to tune the graduation threshold from 8 to 12, they have to `grep` for `8` across the entire codebase. Structured logging enables debugging production issues without adding print statements.

### 16.10.1 Structured Logging
**Problem**: Current logging is `print()` statements and Streamlit's built-in logger. No structured format, no log levels, no correlation IDs.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Configure Python `logging` module with structured format (JSON or key=value)
- [ ] Add log levels: DEBUG for classification details, INFO for session events, WARNING for degraded states, ERROR for failures
- [ ] Add session correlation ID to all log entries (trace a full request through the pipeline)
- [ ] Replace all `print()` and `st.write()` debug statements with proper `logger.debug()`/`.info()`
- [ ] Log classification decisions with confidence, method, and timing
- [ ] Log safety pipeline actions (crisis detection, cooldown trigger, redirect)

### 16.10.2 Extract Magic Numbers to Configuration
**Problem**: 50+ bare numeric literals scattered across core files. Examples:
- Turn limits (various values in `ai_wellness_guide.py`)
- Lookback windows (day counts in `wellness_tracker.py`)
- Cache sizes (`max_entries=100` in `llm_classifier.py`)
- Thresholds (emotional weight scores, dependency scores, anti-engagement factors)
- Context decay turns (7 for reflection_redirect, 5 for high_weight in `ai_wellness_guide.py`)
- Rate limits (max dismissals, max asks per session, follow-up delays)

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create `scenarios/config/system_defaults.yaml` with all tunables organized by component:
  ```yaml
  classification:
    cache_max_size: 100
    cache_ttl_seconds: 3600
    llm_timeout_seconds: 30
    practical_timeout_seconds: 120
  context:
    reflection_redirect_decay_turns: 7
    high_weight_decay_turns: 5
    sensitive_domain_decay_turns: 4
  graduation:
    max_dismissals: 3
  safety:
    max_asks_per_session: 2
    cooldown_turns: 3
  ```
- [ ] Load config at startup via `ScenarioLoader`
- [ ] Replace all bare literals with config lookups
- [ ] Document each setting with description and valid range

### 16.10.3 Environment-Specific Configurations
- [ ] Development mode: verbose logging, relaxed timeouts, no rate limits
- [ ] Production mode: structured JSON logging, strict timeouts, rate limits enabled
- [ ] Test mode: minimal logging, instant timeouts, mock-friendly defaults
- [ ] Mode selected via `EMPATHYSYNC_ENV` environment variable (default: `development`)
- [ ] Add to `.env.example` with explanations

### 16.10.4 YAML Schema Validation
**Problem**: YAML config files have no schema validation. A missing key or wrong type causes a runtime `KeyError` minutes into a session, not at startup.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Define expected schema for each YAML config file (using `jsonschema` or simple manual validation)
- [ ] Validate all YAML files at startup in `health_check.py`
- [ ] Report specific errors: "scenarios/domains/health.yaml: missing required key 'triggers'"
- [ ] Block startup on critical schema violations
- [ ] Warn on deprecated/unknown keys (forward compatibility)

### 16.10.5 Performance Metrics
- [ ] Track and log classification latency (p50, p95, p99)
- [ ] Track cache hit rate (LLM classification cache, domain trigger cache)
- [ ] Track Ollama response time distribution
- [ ] Expose via `/metrics` endpoint (or local file) for debugging
- [ ] Optional: Prometheus-compatible format for users who want dashboards

---
**Goal**: empathySync runs as a background service with cross-session memory, scheduled check-ins, and self-governance — an agent that actively tries to make itself less needed.

**Why this matters**: Currently empathySync only exists when the user opens it. A persistent daemon can do things a session-bound app cannot: remind you to check in with a friend, notice you haven't needed it in a week (and celebrate that), or go quiet when it detects over-reliance. The restraint philosophy extends to the agent's own behavior.

### 17.1 Background Daemon Process 🔜 PLANNED
**Problem**: empathySync only runs when the user opens Streamlit. No way to deliver scheduled nudges or track long-term patterns between sessions.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create `src/daemon/agent.py` — long-running process with event loop
- [ ] Platform-specific service files:
  - `systemd/empathysync.service` for Linux
  - `launchd/com.empathysync.agent.plist` for macOS
- [ ] Graceful startup/shutdown with PID file management
- [ ] Health endpoint for monitoring (local socket, not HTTP)
- [ ] Resource-conscious: sleep when idle, wake on schedule or IPC signal
- [ ] Daemon uses `ConversationSession` from Phase 16 (no Streamlit dependency)

### 17.2 Cross-Session Memory 🔜 PLANNED
**Problem**: Each session starts fresh. The agent can't remember "you were working through a difficult decision last Tuesday" or "you said you'd talk to your sister about this."

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Extend SQLite schema with `session_summaries` table (auto-generated, not raw transcripts)
- [ ] End-of-session summary generation (topic, emotional arc, commitments made, handoffs initiated)
- [ ] Cross-session context injection: "Last time, you mentioned wanting to talk to [person] about [topic]"
- [ ] Memory decay: summaries age out after configurable retention period
- [ ] User can view and delete any stored summaries (data ownership)

### 17.3 Scheduled Nudges 🔜 PLANNED
**Problem**: The trusted network feature tracks reach-outs but can't proactively remind users to maintain connections.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Configurable nudge types:
  - "You haven't checked in with [trusted person] in 2 weeks"
  - "You committed to talking to someone about [topic] — how did it go?"
  - "It's been a while since you used empathySync. That might be a good thing."
- [ ] Delivery via system notification (desktop notification API)
- [ ] Nudge frequency caps (max 2/week, respect quiet hours)
- [ ] Snooze and permanently dismiss options

### 17.4 Self-Restriction Engine 🔜 PLANNED
**Problem**: A persistent agent has more surface area for creating dependency. The agent needs to govern its own behavior.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Agent tracks its own influence score:
  - How often does the user engage with nudges?
  - Is nudge engagement increasing? (concerning)
  - Are nudges leading to more sessions? (very concerning)
  - Are nudges leading to human reach-outs? (success)
- [ ] Self-restriction tiers:
  - **Normal**: Standard nudge schedule
  - **Cautious**: Reduce nudge frequency by 50%
  - **Quiet**: Only crisis-relevant nudges, otherwise silent
  - **Dormant**: Agent goes fully quiet, shows "I'm still here if you need me" on next user-initiated session
- [ ] Tier transitions are logged in policy events (transparency)
- [ ] User can override tiers, but the agent explains why it went quiet

### 17.5 Inactivity as Success Metric 🔜 PLANNED
- [ ] Track periods of non-use (especially for sensitive topics)
- [ ] Celebrate milestones: "You haven't needed me for emotional support in 30 days. That's real growth."
- [ ] Distinguish: practical usage staying steady = fine; sensitive usage declining = success
- [ ] Surface in "My Patterns" dashboard when user returns

**Files to create**:
- `src/daemon/agent.py` — Background agent event loop
- `src/daemon/scheduler.py` — Nudge scheduling and delivery
- `src/daemon/self_restriction.py` — Influence tracking and self-governance
- `systemd/empathysync.service` — Linux service file
- `launchd/com.empathysync.agent.plist` — macOS service file

**Files to modify**:
- `src/utils/database.py` — Add session_summaries table, nudge_history table
- `src/utils/storage_backend.py` — Add methods for session summaries and nudge tracking
- `src/utils/wellness_tracker.py` — Add inactivity celebration logic

---

## Phase 18: Messaging Integration 🔜 PLANNED
**Goal**: empathySync meets users where they are — WhatsApp, Signal, Slack — while maintaining all safety guarantees identically.

**Why this matters**: Not everyone will open a Streamlit app or terminal. Messaging integration lets empathySync exist as a quiet presence in the tools people already use. But this is also the highest-risk phase for dependency: always-available AI in your messaging app is exactly what the restraint philosophy warns against.

**Prerequisite**: Phase 16 (InterfaceAdapter) and Phase 17 (daemon) must be complete.

### 18.1 Messaging Adapter Framework 🔜 PLANNED
**Problem**: Each messaging platform has different APIs, message formats, and delivery semantics. Need a unified adapter layer.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create `src/interfaces/messaging/` package:
  - `base.py` — `MessagingAdapter` extending `InterfaceAdapter` with async message handling
  - `whatsapp.py` — WhatsApp Business API adapter
  - `signal.py` — Signal CLI adapter
  - `slack.py` — Slack webhook adapter
- [ ] Each adapter handles:
  - Receiving messages (webhook or polling)
  - Sending responses (platform API)
  - Platform-specific formatting (no markdown in SMS, Slack blocks for Slack, etc.)
  - Rate limiting per platform's API constraints

### 18.2 Message Queue 🔜 PLANNED
**Problem**: Messaging is asynchronous. Need to decouple message receipt from processing.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Local message queue (SQLite-backed, no external dependencies)
- [ ] Queue flow: platform webhook → queue → daemon processes → response queued → platform delivery
- [ ] Retry logic for failed deliveries
- [ ] Message deduplication (platforms sometimes send duplicates)
- [ ] Queue depth monitoring (if backing up, something is wrong)

### 18.3 Safety Pipeline Parity 🔜 PLANNED
**Critical requirement**: Every safety guarantee from the Streamlit app must work identically in messaging mode.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] All safety pipeline steps apply: crisis detection, cooldown, turn limits, dependency scoring, identity reminders
- [ ] Crisis detection triggers platform-appropriate response (crisis line numbers, not "click this button")
- [ ] Cooldown enforcement: "I'm stepping back for a bit. Please reach out to [trusted person] or [crisis line]."
- [ ] Turn limits enforced per conversation thread
- [ ] Dependency scoring works across messaging sessions (not just within one)
- [ ] Audit: side-by-side test suite verifying identical safety behavior across Streamlit, CLI, and messaging

### 18.4 Opt-Out & Data Portability 🔜 PLANNED
- [ ] One-message opt-out: "stop" or "unsubscribe" immediately halts all messaging
- [ ] Data export before disconnect: user receives all their data as JSON
- [ ] Platform disconnection doesn't delete local data (user can reconnect later)
- [ ] Clear onboarding explaining what data is stored and how messaging works
- [ ] No message content stored on any external server (messages relayed through local daemon)

### 18.5 Anti-Engagement in Messaging Mode 🔜 PLANNED
**Why this needs its own section**: A messaging-based AI assistant is inherently more accessible and therefore more dependency-prone. Extra safeguards are required.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Messaging-specific dependency signals:
  - Response time tracking: Is the user sending messages faster than they can process responses?
  - Time-of-day patterns: Escalating late-night messaging = concerning
  - Message frequency: More than N messages/hour triggers gentle slowdown
- [ ] Agent-initiated conversation limits: daemon never starts a conversation on sensitive topics
- [ ] Mandatory cool-off: After turn limit reached, agent responds only with "I'm here if you need practical help. For what's on your mind, please reach out to [trusted person]."
- [ ] Periodic "Do you still want me here?" check: opt-in renewal every 30 days

**Files to create**:
- `src/interfaces/messaging/base.py` — Messaging adapter base class
- `src/interfaces/messaging/whatsapp.py` — WhatsApp Business API integration
- `src/interfaces/messaging/signal.py` — Signal CLI integration
- `src/interfaces/messaging/slack.py` — Slack webhook integration
- `src/daemon/message_queue.py` — Local SQLite-backed message queue

**Files to modify**:
- `src/daemon/agent.py` — Integrate message queue processing
- `src/utils/database.py` — Add message queue and messaging session tables

---

## Philosophical Safeguards (Phases 16-18)

Each agent evolution phase must maintain these cross-cutting guarantees:

1. **Anti-engagement in daemon mode**: The agent actively tries to make itself less needed. A persistent agent that doesn't self-restrict is an engagement trap wearing a wellness mask.

2. **Dependency scoring applies to background nudges**: If nudge engagement correlates with increased sessions (not human reach-outs), the agent reduces nudges. The same dependency math that governs conversations governs the agent's own behavior.

3. **Human primacy**: The agent never replaces the trusted network — it reminds you to use it. Every nudge should point toward a human, not back toward the agent.

4. **Local-first**: Even in messaging mode, all processing stays on-device. Messages are relayed through the local daemon. No conversation data touches external servers beyond the minimum required for message delivery.

5. **Self-restriction**: The agent can vote to go quiet if it detects over-reliance. This isn't a bug or a missing feature — it's the core product working as intended.

## Current Status (2026-02-10)

**Completed**: Phases 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6.5, 7, 8 (Core), 9, 9.1, 9.5, 11.1-11.7, 12, 13, 14 (Core), 15, and 16

**Next Up**: Hardening Phases 16.5-16.10 (Type Safety → Async I/O → Security → God Class Decomposition → Test Coverage → Observability)

**Why hardening before Phase 17?** The Persistent Agent Daemon (Phase 17) adds a long-running background process, cross-session memory, scheduled nudges, and self-governance. Building that on top of god classes, synchronous I/O, untested persistence, and 50+ magic numbers would compound every existing issue. Fix the foundation first, then build upward.

**Recommended order**:
1. Phase 16.9 (Test Coverage) — safety net before any refactoring
2. Phase 16.5 (Type Safety) — enums and dataclasses make refactoring safer
3. Phase 16.7 (Security) — fix race conditions and injection vectors
4. Phase 16.6 (Async I/O) — unblock daemon architecture
5. Phase 16.8 (God Class Decomposition) — clean architecture for Phase 17
6. Phase 16.10 (Observability) — debug infrastructure for daemon development

**Recent Bug Fixes**:
- Fixed post-crisis apology bug: LLM no longer apologizes for crisis interventions
  - Added `post_crisis_turn` state tracking in WellnessGuide

**All Core Phases Complete!**

**Distribution Readiness** (Complete):
- Phase 13: Project Health & Stability ✅
- Phase 14: Packaging & Distribution ✅
- Phase 15: CI/CD & Documentation ✅
- Phase 16: Core Decoupling ✅

**Hardening** (Current — do before Phase 17):
- Phase 16.5: Type Safety & Data Contracts (enums, dataclasses, type annotations)
- Phase 16.6: Async I/O & Performance (httpx, regex pre-compile, Aho-Corasick triggers)
- Phase 16.7: Security Hardening (atomic lock, secrets, SQL injection, rate limits, input validation)
- Phase 16.8: God Class Decomposition (WellnessTracker, WellnessGuide, ScenarioLoader, StorageBackend, RiskClassifier)
- Phase 16.9: Test Coverage Expansion (6 untested files, error injection, concurrency, security tests)
- Phase 16.10: Observability & Configuration (structured logging, magic numbers → YAML, env configs, schema validation)

**Agent Evolution** (After hardening):
- Phase 17: Persistent Agent Daemon (background service, scheduled nudges, self-restriction)
- Phase 18: Messaging Integration (WhatsApp, Signal, Slack adapters with safety parity)

**Feature Backlog** (Lower Priority):
- Phase 8.5: AI Literacy Moments (educational prompts, max 1/week)
- Phase 8.6: "Spot the Pattern" Feature (manipulation pattern education)
- Phase 10: Advanced Detection (semantic intent, conversation flow analysis — long-term)

## Guiding Principles (Never Compromise)

1. **Local-first**: All data stays on device. No exceptions.
2. **Optimize for exit**: Success = users need us less.
3. **Practical ≠ Emotional**: Complete tasks fully, restrain on feelings.
4. **Transparency**: Show why decisions were made.
5. **Human primacy**: Always point to humans for what matters.
6. **No dark patterns**: Never optimize for engagement.
7. **Fail safe**: When uncertain, be brief and redirect.
